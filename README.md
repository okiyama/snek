# snek
The classic game Snake recreated using p5.js. I got the idea to do this from Dan Shiffman's excellent [Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaGK-fj-BAM) Youtube series.
Though I've avoided watching any of the video so I can solve the problem myself, then compare afterwards.

I'm enjoying p5.js, visual programming is fun and it's amazing how expressive the environment can be. Great way to practice up on my vanilla JS too.
